# Fake News Detection Using GLoVE Embedding

This project focuses on detecting fake news using GLoVE Embedding and various deep learning algorithms. The aim is to build a robust model that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake.

## Project Overview

The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
3. **GLoVE Embedding**: Using GLoVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation) to represent words as vectors.
4. **Model Building**: Constructing various deep learning models to classify the news articles.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains news articles with labels indicating whether they are real or fake. The data is preprocessed to remove any noise and to make it suitable for training the models.
